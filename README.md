# App

****Notes****
npm run or node server.js to run server

npm run in client folder to run front-end 

Chat is half working.

Open two localhosts when running to see what the problem is.

Upon start you will be prompted with entering a username and a group name enter whatever except for group name enter a number instead of an actual name
so should be group number not group name.

Colors are all wacky right now so just ignore it.

My next task is getting MongoDB to work so that we can just extract the messages from the database and make them appear in the chat.

Sorry for bad explanation lol

And also sorry my files are a little messy

Main files are "server.js" 

mongoModules folder contains a schema I was messing with 

In CLient folder go to src folder and you will find all the files for the front-end ignore test.js and reportWebVitals.js
