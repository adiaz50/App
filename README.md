# App

****Notes****
npm run or node server.js to run server
npm run in client folder to run frontend 

chat is half working 
open two localhosts when running to see what the problem is. 
Upon start you will be prompted with entering a username and a group name enter whatever except for group name enter a number instead of an actual name 
so should be group number not group name. 
Colors are all wacky right now so just ignore it 
My next task is getting MongoDB to work so that we can just extract the messages from the database and make them appear in the chat 

Sorry for bad explanation lol 
And also sorry my files are a little messy 
Main files are "server.js" 
mongoModules folder contains a schema I was messing with 
In CLient folder go to src folder and you will find all the files for the front end ignore test.js and reportWebVitals.js
